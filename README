---:[ Description

This module is a Perl extension to create and send ARP packets and lookup
local or remote mac addresses.
You do not need to install any additional libraries like Libnet to compile 
this extension. It uses kernel header files to create the packets.


---:[ IMPORTANT NOTICE

Version 1.0 will break with the API of PRE-1.0 versions, 
because the return value of arp_lookup() and get_mac()
will no longer be passed as parameter, but returned!
I hope this decision is ok as long as we get a cleaner and more perlish API.


---:[ Installation

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


---:[ Usage

Please read the POD documentation: perldoc Net::ARP.
If you've still any questions feel free to ask.
